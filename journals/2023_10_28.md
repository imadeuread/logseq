	  collapsed:: true
		- Indeed, love is the most important of all. Having knowledge, gift and talent are good things, but everything is worthless, of no value if there is no love. And what is love, love is patient, kind. It is not proud, it is not boast. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Here we can see that love also not just passive, that just accepts things as it comes. Love is also proactive, it protects, if you love someone or something, you protect it, you stand for it, you fight for it. And that is what Jesus Christ did, He loved us, so He came and fought for us. How? Buy teaching us what is love, showing us what is love. He ultimately showed us how powerful love is, by sacrificing himself for our sins. Love
