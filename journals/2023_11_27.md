			- **Promise**: There is a season or time for everything. But one thing is constant, never changing, and that is God. He is the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end. He is both the judge and the defender for us. And the promise is that there a seasons in our life. And he is present in all those seasons. It maybe happy season, a sad season, a bountiful or a season of less. But know that God is always there and he will be with us through every season making sure that we are able to get past these seasons of our life.
