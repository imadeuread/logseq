			- **Sin to Avoid**:
			  Abram demonstrated yet again his obedience to the Lord. Verses 18-23 highlights it. Melchizedek and the king of Sodom met him after his victory over the allied army of Chedorlaomer. Melchizedek honored and praised the God whom Abram served and also whom he served. And Abram offered his tithe to the Lord and gave it to Melchizedek. Meanwhile, the king of Sodom offered Abram all of the treasure spoils of war. Abram didn't accept the offer knowing that God's favor and promise is enough for him and nothing else. But he also arranged for the rewards of the men that were with him.
