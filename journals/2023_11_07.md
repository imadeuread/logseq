	- Notes: The price for idol worship is great. The Lord wants us to focus on Him. Even if what we are doing is good, if it's not for the Lord, then it is not good. Focus on what God wants you to do. Focus on the task He has given you not on others or other things. We tend to see what others do right or do wrong, and we fail to realize what we ourselves should be doing. And sometimes we also idolize people who we see do good things for the Lord. At first we try to be like them, then later on we idolize them. Stay focus on the Lord.
