			- Command:
			  It's not a command per se, but here Jonah shows us that yes, sometimes we tend to shy away or run away from what God is calling us to do. Whether it is in our ministry or in our personal life choices, but more often than not we tend to go about our own way and plans and not in his plans. And that's when we encounter big problems. And here Jonah realized his mistakes and asked and prayed to the Lord for forgiveness, for deliverance, and for help. He realized God's sovereignty and his good in his life. And as a person who believes in God, I can relate to what Jonah experienced. When God calls on us, or burdens us on something, sometimes fear comes first. And today I pray that I may learn to be courageous and stand firm to what God has called me to.
