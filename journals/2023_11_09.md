		- What strikes to me the most in this scripture is of Paul's courage and calmness. Even though he knew what would happen to him when he goes to Jerusalem, he is still willing to go because the Lord led him to Jerusalem. Having full surrender and trust in the Lord is indeed a very liberating feeling. Being unbound by the shackles of sin and this world.
