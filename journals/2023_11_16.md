	- Notes
		- **Command:** ==Consider the advice of the elders appointed by God==. Having a counsel of elders is a good thing, their wisdom accumulated throughout the years are very much important. That is why it is always good to consider their advice, as long as it doesn't go against the will and word of God.
		- Promise:
		- **Sin to Avoid:** First, is ==*revenge*==. Rehoboam, after establishing his kingship in Judah tried to take revenge on Israel because they revolted against him. But God commanded Rehoboam to stop. It is not in our hands to take revenge, but it is in the hands of God. Second, is ==*idolatry*==. Jeroboam, because of his fears that his own people will also revolt against him just as they did to Rehoboam, made the blunder of making gold calves as idols. The Lord God is most angry at having idol worship. Just like Jeroboam, we have fears and anxieties. But we have to learn to have faith and trust in our Lord. He is sovereign over all. Trust His ways, will and timing.
