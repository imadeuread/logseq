		- Sin to Avoid: In Nahum 3, the people of Nineveh, the Assyrians where very drunk in worldly affairs. They were cruel to their enemies, murdered everyone and paraded their corpses. They practiced paganistic witchcraft, they pursued their fleshly desires. And the Lord God warns them that He will punish them for this. And indeed God destroyed the city of Nineveh in ruins. The Lord reminds me through this passage to not to live a life of sinning. To not be like Nineveh, who was filled with greed, pride, lusts of the flesh and cruelty. A city built on sin. May the Lord God have mercy on me and keep me from becoming a Nineveh.
