	- Jeremiah 1 #calling 
	  The Lord God reminds me today that indeed He calls me. Before I was born, formed in my mother's womb He knew me, that He set me apart. And just like Jeremiah, I don't know how to speak, I don't know what to do. But the Lord says Do not say those things, Do not be afraid, I am with You and will rescue You. The Lord assured me today, that indeed what I see is from Him. It is His word. And he commands, get yourself ready. Take courage, take heart. Stan up anf say to them whatever I command you. Do not be terrified and afraid. Today I have made you a fortified city. They will fight against you assures the Lord, but He promises that He will be with me.
