		- Scripture: Genesis 12:1-9
		- tags:: obedience, call-to-abram, abrahamic-covenant
		- Notes
			- **Command**: Leave the land of Ur and go to Canaan
			- **Promise**:
			  1. Great Nation
			  2. Will be blessed
			  3. Will make his name great
			  4. Will become a blessing
			  5. Bless those who bless Abram
			  6. Curse those who curse Abram
			  7. All the people on earth will be blessed through Abram
			- At the beginning of the chapter, immediately God instructs Abram to leave his country, his father's household, and go to the land God will show him. And God made 7 promises to Abram.
			- Immediately, Abram left as the Lord has told him bringing along his wife, his possessions accumulated together with the people he had acquired in Haran, and his nephew Lot.
			- Sometimes, just like the situation Abraham was in, God calls us out to where He intends us to be or for what He purposes us to do. And when god calls us out to somewhere unfamiliar, unknown, and foreign, personally, what would our response be? For me, personally, a person who is overly careful to at fault, would be thinking it over many a times over, even with the promises that comes along with it. And maybe even bargain with the Lord if there's an alternative.
			- Compared to Abram, his response was to follow the Lord without even a hint of hesitation.
			- And that is what I admire and would like to follow for myself. Reading the bible daily, hearing the word
