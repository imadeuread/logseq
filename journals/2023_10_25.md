		- verse 1 - 4
			- Indeed, all glory to God. Paul reminds us that in Christ Jesus, there is no condemnation, but freedom. Paul reassures us of the promise that if anyone of us is truly in Christ, who truly accepted Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior, is free, free from condemnation.
			- This passage rings out to me powerfully this morning. Just as each morning, we are reminded of God's grace and mercy. Each morning, everyday, the enemy tries to remind us of who we were and of our sins. He constantly puts us on guilt trips. But all glory to God, for He reminds us and assures us not to feel condemned but to free of it because we alone fall short, but it is the finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ. We need not worry about it because it is done. Glory to God in the highest.

	- Branding
		- A brand is more than a name, or logo, or slogan
		- A brand is a unique identity. It's how your audience views your organization. It's a story your audience tells themselves about who you are. Everything you do to influence that outside perception is branding.
	- Church Branding
		- It's a physical reflection of the heart and spirituality
		- Tagline is important
		- Our brand is what we want to be, but also what we are.
