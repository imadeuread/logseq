			  **verse 6 - 10** The burden for preachers is to make sure of the gospel they are preaching. Here apostle Paul reminds and warns us to be very careful of the things that we preach. To not deviate from the truth that Jesus Christ has taught and of the written word of God. Study the bible well, in-depth, and in context. Learn and practice the correct and proper way of interpreting the written word of God, and stick to it. Praise be to God for his written words and his powerful works.
