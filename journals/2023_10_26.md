		- Just like King David, as we continue to live a life for the Lord, our foes increase. And these foes come from the world, and they come many forms, also in numbers. But the promise of the Lord is this, that He is our shield and that He will hear our cries of help. He is the one that sustains us. So when there are enemies, fret not. Cry out to the Lord, ask for His help, guidance and wisdom. And trust in Him for He has never lost a battle.

			- a. Church Planting
			- b. Ministry
			- c. C2S
		- Ministry is like a marathon. In order to finish, you have to have dedication, endurance and most importantly pacing/cadence. #analogy
		- Are you listening to God's calling or are you listening to your own heart? Be ready to let go of something good for the best or for where/what is God calling you?
