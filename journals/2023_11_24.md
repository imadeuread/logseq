			- Command:
			- Promise: The Lord God assures his people that he is faithful to his covenant and promises. He is a faithful God, and he will make sure all of his promises and his covenant to his people will come to pass. He also assures us of provision when doing the work of the Lord. God describes that when we are doing labor, we do not receive a full, equal compensation for our work. But in service of the God, it will not be the same. God will make sure that your needs are met, He will bless you according to his riches and glory, not by our earthly riches standard.
