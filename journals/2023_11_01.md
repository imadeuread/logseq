	- Revelation 22 #2ndcoming #apostasy #reward #promise
		- The Lord will be coming soon. Bringing with Him all His glory, majesty, and sovereignty. And He will keep careful audit for our accounts in His name and bringing with Him the rewards for those who have been faithful and labored for the Lord. He reminds us that we should stay true and faithful to the Word of God as it is written, not adding nor removing parts of it. He tells us that there will be a terrible consequence in doing so. That's why it is important for us to study, know by heart the Bible in order for us not to be easily swayed and we can stand firm and grounded in His Word.  He reminds us the importance of righteousness. His righteousness that covers us. For we are not righteous, but only Him. It is a reminder to always have a humble heart, for everything is His own works not ours. Blessed be the Lord. For His coming is near and His Words and His promises shall remain forever.
