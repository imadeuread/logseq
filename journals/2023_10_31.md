	- 1 Corinthians 12 #spiritual #gifts #body
		- Hallelujah! Praise and glory to Lord. In serving God, I always want to give everything that I can do in everything way that I can find. Gawa dito, gawa diyan. Punta dito, punta diyan. And honestly, sometimes I reach the point of exhaustion and burnout. I love the Lord, and am enthusiastic about serving Him and being of use to His ministry, His church. But this morning the Lord through His word reminds me, that we can't do everything. May kanya kanya tayong pagkatawag. We are a part of the body, where we have our own intended function and purpose. But also, we are part of the body, so we need to cooperate and work with the other parts in order for the body to function properly. Take care of each other, remind each other, and encourage on another. Yes Lord, thank you for designing us this way. To you belong all the glory and honor, together with the highest praises and heartfelt thanksgivings.
