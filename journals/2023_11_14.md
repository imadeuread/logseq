	- Notes:
		- **Command:** To follow the Lord's instructions. Joseph was exemplary in this regard. He was indeed a man of integrity. Even before having been visited by the angel of the Lord in his dreams, after finding out that Mary his fiancee, was with child, he didn't made a public spectacle of it. He was of kind heart, so he decided to just Mary her and then quietly divorce here afterwards in order to preserve Mary's integrity. But the angel of the Lord came to him in a dream and instructed him. And he was faithful in obeying  what angel of the Lord has instructed him.
