		- Scripture: Daniel 6
		- Tags: #integrity #persecution #prayer #faithulness #excellence
		- Notes: Daniel faced numerous persecution, evil plots and trials in his life, but he continued on to live a life of integrity. A life of excellence, not of perfection. And throughout his there is this one recurring theme, that is his life is founded in prayer and faithfulness to God. Here I learn from Daniel, that in spite of everything going around his life, Daniel focused to what was really important. Faithfulness and prayer. Being faithful to God's word and will even when everyone seems to be against you, exercising that faith into integrity. And having a prayer life, a close relationship to God.
