		- verse 37-39
			- Things happen for a reason. Either good or bad situations/predicaments, the Lord is the one who is in control. The Lord permits everything that happens in our life. And most often than not, bad situations happen in our lives as a result of our actions. Of our stubbornness, of our  sinning.
		- verse 40-41
			- The Good News is that God gives us chances. A chance to examine ourselves, our ways and turn back to Him. To go back and depend on Him once more. To turn from our evil ways and depend on His magnificent grace and mercy. Learn to humble yourself before the Lord, accept the consequences of your actions, and learn to live a life full of dependance upon the grace, mercy and will of God.

				- 24hrs a day is enough **Ecclesiastes 3:1**
			- > The secret in balancing LIFE is to put God first in everything you do. Life is not all about church, work, or family. Focusing on one aspect in LIFE will lead to burnout. what we need to do is to enjoy LIFE! It is a balance of every aspect of LIFE **-- Matthew 6:33**
			- > I reached the pinnacle of success in the business world. In others' eyes, my life is an epitome of success. However, aside from work, I have little joy. In the end, wealth is only a fact of life that I am accustomed to. Material things lost can be found. But there is one thing that can never be found when it is lost - LIFE. Enjoy LIFE! **-- Steve Jobs**
