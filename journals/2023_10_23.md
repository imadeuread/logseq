	- Galatians 1
		- verse 6-10 #apostasy #gospel #perversion
			- As a Christians, the apostle Paul reminds us to be vigilant, of false teachings and doctrines. He goes in so far as to be amazed by how fast some if not all fall prey to these false gospels. And what is true during the time of the apostle Paul, is true to our modern times. Apostate gospel and preaching has become rampant in today's Christian Community. With the advancement of technology in telecom and in the information sector, false teachings are far reaching in the lives of us modern day Christians.
		- verse 11-24
			- Just as Paul diagnoses the problem of apostasy in the church of Galatia, he provides the antidote/solution to it together with assurance.
			- **Firstly**, Paul writes and assures us the authenticity of the Gospel he has preached. He assures to us that the Gospel he has preached and what we received is the that of Jesus Christ. How does he come to assure us of this? It is by his testimony of the grace and transforming power of the Lord Jesus Christ. That it is by His Grace and mercy that everything was revealed to Paul. There was an encounter, that happened with the Lord Jesus Christ. Paul even went as far as to testify that even at the time of him in his mother's womb, the Lord has set His plan and will on Him assuring that what has all happened is of God's will and of God's plan.
			- **Secondly**, the antidote is God's grace and the relationship that we have with Him. In order to guard our minds and hearts of apostate gospel and preaching, we must come to know of who God is and His Words. And how do we to this? Study, dwell and devote time on the Word of God. Yes, the most important foundation of our faith is that of the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ on the cross to redeem us from our sins and us accepting Him and confessing that He is indeed the Lord and Savior, but it doesn't stop there. We must also submit to His will if we are truly of Him. And how do we do that? Buy knowing more about Him through the study of His Word, the doctrines that He has taught. Let us feed our minds and our hearts with His Words, how He lived and who He is. And not just learning about all of these, but also applying it in our lives. So that our lives becomes as a living testimony of God's Grace and mercy. That the gospel of Jesus Christ truly indeed is true and forever transforms people lives from that of death and now of life.
