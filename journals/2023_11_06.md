	- 2 Kings 10-11
		- King Jehu followed the law and what God has him do. But King Jehu took advantage of it for his gain. Also he was selective in enacting judgement. Just like what I said earlier, he obeyed God and hilled Ahab and his family and his loyal followers only to gain political strength. He neglected to follow God's command fully. Sometimes ganyan ang tendency ng pag-iisip ng tao, minsan ako din ganyan. We become selective of God's word to fit or to have an advanatage over others. Kaya Lord I pray for forgiveness. Have a heart fully surrendered to His will no matter what the cost. Focus on the task, not on what I have to gain. Thank you Lord for Your words of reminder to focus.
