		- The striking thing here for me is keeping promises made to the Lord. We should not make light of the promises we make to the Lord, and make every effort to fulfill it. And one other thing is sober/calmness of Solomon in making decisions. Solomon didn't make his decision out of his anger or emotion, but rather he set aside his emotions and based it on rational, calm decision making. Sabi nga nila, when emotions are high, intelligence is low. To God be the glory!
