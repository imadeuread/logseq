		- Sin to Avoid: Idolatry, greed, luxury, and idleness. These are the prevalent sins the people of Israel has been doing. And the Lord God promises punishment against His people. Not only punishment but He assures total destruction of all things that are offensive to Him. In today's world, just like Israel in the time of Amos, people have turned back against God. People have given up on believing God, have taken for themselves their own as their god, prioritized self-centeredness, luxury that doesn't glorify God and adulterous relationships. But just as God destroyed Israel on Amos' time, He will also destroy this world. When Jesus comes back the 2nd time, He will rightfully destroy seat at the throne for all to see and submit and bow down to His Glory and Power. Oh blessed be the Lord God Almighty. May he keep us from temptations and give us the courage and strength to endure.
